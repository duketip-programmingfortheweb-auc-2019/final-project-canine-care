          <h2>2019</h2>
          <p>The year of 2019 was a year for the company of Canine Care to look back on all the accomplishments the buisness made throughout the years since it started. For it was the 20th annual anniversary, of the company that makes it easier for you to take care of your canine companion. The goal for the next few years is to get locations across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The organization hopes to make many dogs throughout the world have the best lives they can possibly have.</p>

  <h2>2014</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately, one sorrowful night in November, 2014, the dog of the one Numero Nueve died of old age. Numero grieved for weeks thinking he would never find a more perfect dog. However he was wrong, he was able to find a good canine friend after only a few weeks of searching. While the dog would not replace his friend since the begining of the company, the new pup still warmed Mr. Nueve's heart. Because it took him so long to find a new dog for himself, they decided to make a way for other people to find their perfect dog faster and easier. They created the 'Find YOUR Dog' program. It became very successful in the years following.</p>

      <h2>2012</h2>
      <p>Even though it took about seven years, Canine Care still managed to make it so they had locations in practically every state of the United States. This was also the year they introduced the dog training services to the large and very well-known company. Little did Mr. Nueve know, things in the next few years would get rough.</p>

    <h2>2005</h2>
    <p>This is the year that Canine Care expanded from just a well-known local shop to having locations all over the state of Texas. This was a very big accomplishment for Mr. Nueve since Texas is the second largest state in the US. For Mr. Nueve, this meant that he was only a few steps away from helping dogs all over the world.</p>

        <h2>1999</h2>
        <p>Just like all big, money-maker companies Canine Care started out in the garage of our founder, the one and only Numero Nueve. This garage was located in Archer County, Texas. Mr. Nueve was a young person who just wanted the best for the neighborhood dogs, so they decided to start an organization that would help dogs all over. They called that organization Canine Care. The buisness went from small to large in only a couple of years.</p>
